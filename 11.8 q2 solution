Assume that type Money, a structure with two int fields, dollars and cents, has been declared.
Write the definition of a function named normalize that receives a Money argument and returns a Money value.
What it returns is the "normalized" equivalent of the argument, that is, a value that is equivalent but where cents is a number between 0 and 99 inclusive.
So if a Money value of 5 dollars and 325 cents was passed, a Money value of 8 dollars and 25 cents would be returned.

Money normalize(Money r){
     
    while(r.cents > 99){
    r.cents -= 100;
    r.dollars += 1;}
    
    return r;
